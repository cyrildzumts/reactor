This repository contains an implementation of the circuit breaker pattern in C++.
This work is a part of my bachelor thesis at the HAW Hamburg university.
UPDATE : This code was a preview of my Thesis. The final and Updated code is not shared here publicly since it will serve as a basis 
for a reactive C++ Library that will help  build reactive Systems.
